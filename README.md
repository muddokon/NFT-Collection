# NFT-Collection For Crypto Kids

This project aims to provide a simple platform for interacting with an ERC721 contract generation system.

This makes possible to generate so known NFTs from such system.

## Update on using Hardhat environment:
Be aware of HH errors regarding project generation outside Unix systems. Windows 8 and 10 don't leverage any WSL susbystem by default, so you must set it up manually or use an elevated shell such as Powershell.
